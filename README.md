# FFXI Map DATS

A collection of modified DAT files for FFXI that show additional details on the in-game maps, including:

* Zone exits/entrances
* Unmapped areas
* Blocked paths
* NM spawn locations
* Quest locations

**Note: This is a work in progress. More zones will become available as time goes by.**

## Example

![East Ronfaure](psd/ROM/17/25.png)

## The List

A list of covered zones is available in the [ZONES](ZONES.md) file. If you see a map that is not covered yet, I can prioritise it if you [raise an issue](https://github.com/xurion/ffxi-map-dats/issues) ðŸ˜„

## Source

These maps are pulled from, and credit goes to, [BG Wiki](https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Main_Page). The original intention was to remove most of the details such as NM pop locations and quest/mission-specific locations to keep the map as clear as possible, but this will happen if future users feel the maps are too noisy. To begin with, I think these are helpful enough.

## Pre installation

Before you install anything, make a backup of your DAT files. Do this by taking a copy of the following directories:

* ...\FINAL FANTASY XI\ROM\17

**Note: More will follow as more maps are covered**

## Installation

Copy all files to the FINAL FANTASY XI directory and choose to overwrite/replace.
